We call this starting point the checkout \\"skeleton\\" because it shows the full tree of all project folders in your monorepo, but without their source code subfolders.  In other words, although the source files for each project are excluded, the skeleton nonetheless allows engineers to remain aware of other team\'s projects, and how their own project relates to those other projects.  This discourages \\"tunnel vision\\" (where engineers pretend their project is the only project in the repository), while still ensuring fast Git performance.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"pages/support/contributing":{"id":"pages/support/contributing","title":"Contributing","description":"Building the projects in this monorepo:","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"pages/support/help":{"id":"pages/support/help","title":"Getting help","description":"If you encounter questions or problems, please create a GitHub issue.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"pages/support/news":{"id":"pages/support/news","title":"What\'s new","description":"To find out what\'s changed in the latest release, please consult the CHANGELOG.md notes.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"}}}')}}]);
