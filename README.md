## Monorepo for Sparo toolkit

<!-- Text below this line should stay in sync with the website index.md -->
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

**Sparo** optimizes performance of Git operations for your large frontend monorepo.

## Key features

- **Familiar interface:** The `sparo` command-line interface (CLI) wrapper offers **better defaults** and **performance suggestions** without altering the familiar `git` syntax. (The native `git` CLI is also supported.)
- **A proven solution:** Git provides [quite a lot of ingredients](./pages/guide/git_features.md) for optimizing very large repos; Sparo is your recipe for combining these features intelligently.
- **Simplified sparse checkout:** Work with sparse checkout [profiles](./pages/guide/sparo_profiles.md) instead of confusing "cones" and globs
- **Frontend integration:** Sparo leverages [Rush](https://rushjs.io/) and [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) workspace configurations, including the ability to automatically checkout project dependencies
- **Dual workflows:** The `sparo-ci` tool implements a specialized checkout model optimized for continuous integration (CI) pipelines
- **Extra safeguards**: Avoid common Git mistakes such as checkouts with staged files outside the active view
- **Go beyond Git hooks:** Optionally collect anonymized Git timing metrics in your monorepo, enabling your build team to set data-driven goals for _local_ developer experience (not just CI!)

  _(Metrics are transmitted to your own service and are not accessible by any other party.)_
